Guided by the course developed by Mr. Andrej Karpathy, I successfully 
created my inaugural babbling generative model. For this instance, 
I employed the mini_shakespeare dataset for training. The resultant model 
generated text—found in 'more.txt'—that, while nonsensical, exhibits a certain
semblance to Shakespearean style, a testament to the model's capacity to
mimic the distinguished playwright's linguistic patterns.
